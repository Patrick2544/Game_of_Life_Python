The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.for more information please [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
